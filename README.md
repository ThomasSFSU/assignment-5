## Description
This project is a demonstration of using HTML and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to create interactive and visually appealing web content. HTML is utilized for structuring the webpage, while SVG is employed for creating vector graphics that scale smoothly without losing quality. The website deliberately does not use any CSS so the styling is very minimal. The reason for this is to focus on key aspects of HTML and SVG without adding design complexity.

## Features
- **Animation**: Incorporates SVG animation to create dynamic visual effects.
- **Basic Shapes**: Demonstrates the use of basic SVG shapes such as rectangles, circles, and polygons to create banners.
- **HTML**: Utilizes simple HTML elements for structuring the webpage and enhancing accessibility.
